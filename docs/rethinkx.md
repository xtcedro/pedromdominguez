## 🌍 Who I Am

My name is **Pedro M. Dominguez**.  
I am a self-taught developer, builder, and founder of **Dominguez Tech Solutions**, based in Oklahoma City.  

I was born in **Ciudad Juárez**, raised in **Oklahoma**, and today I am on a mission to help local businesses and communities **regain sovereignty** in the digital age.

## 🚀 What is DenoGenesis?

**DenoGenesis** is a sovereign-first, realtime-first, professional web framework built entirely from scratch:  

✅ Built with **Deno + TypeScript** → no legacy tech debt  
✅ Runs on **Debian Linux** → full transparency  
✅ Full hybrid stack → **REST + WebSocket** → realtime-first  
✅ Dynamic theming → agency friendly  
✅ Modular architecture → MVC + Services + Models + Middleware  
✅ Realtime **notifications layer** → open, transparent systems  
✅ Designed for agencies, local businesses, nonprofits → **decentralize power**

## 🌟 Why I Built This

I believe we are entering a **new Age of Creation**, as you often say Tony.

But that **Age must be open, sovereign, and transparent** — not locked behind the walls of Big Tech.

I saw how many small businesses in Oklahoma — and beyond — are trapped in closed systems:

- Wix  
- Shopify  
- Webflow  
- Squarespace  
- Locked into opaque SaaS stacks they do not control.

## 🛠️ DenoGenesis is the alternative:

- Built for **agency-first ownership**  
- Built for **local-first ownership**  
- Built for **transparency-first ownership**  
- Built for **realtime, modern UX**  
- Built for **freedom**.

## 💬 Personal Message to Tony Seba

Tony — your work in **RethinkX** has deeply inspired me.

You showed that it is possible to rethink entire sectors, entire architectures.

I believe **software and the web stack itself must now be rethought** — so that individuals and small communities can **own** their digital futures.

**DenoGenesis is my contribution to that vision.**

I built this entire framework from scratch in less than 6 months — with no corporate backing, no team — only conviction.

Because I believe that if we do not act — we will wake up one day to a web entirely controlled by a few platforms.

## 🤝 An Invitation

If this message reaches you, Tony — and if you see value in **sovereign-first architecture**:

- I would be honored to contribute this work to the broader **Age of Creation** movement.  
- I would welcome collaboration, discussion, and community building.

This is just the beginning.

**Together, we can rethink the digital future — and build one where every person, every local community, can thrive.**
