# 📚 Documentation Standards — DenoGenesis
_Establish clear practices for all documentation in the DenoGenesis project._

---

## ✨ Purpose

DenoGenesis is a sovereign-first, transparent architecture — its documentation should reflect these values:

✅ Clarity → easy to follow for developers and agencies  
✅ Transparency → document *why*, not just *how*  
✅ Consistency → common style across all docs  
✅ Professional polish → elevate perception of DenoGenesis as world-class framework  

---

## 🗂️ Docs Directory Structure

- `CHANGELOG.md` → formal version history
- `TODO.md` → short-term implementation priorities
- `Version-Bump-Flow.md` → how versioning is applied
- `Router-Best-Practices.md` → style + architecture guidance for `routes/*.ts`
- `Stage-4-Checklist.md` → milestone checklist for current development stage
- `rethinkx.md` → philosophical / visionary positioning document
- `Documentation-Standards.md` → **(this file)** documentation practices for all contributors

---

## 🖋️ Style Guidelines

✅ Use **Markdown headings** → `#`, `##`, `###`  
✅ Use **bullet lists** → for clarity  
✅ Use **bold text** for important concepts → `**important**`  
✅ Prefer **short paragraphs** → readable on mobile  
✅ Use **horizontal rules** (`---`) to break major sections  
✅ Always include a short **Purpose** section at the top of every doc  

---

## 📝 Writing Principles

1️⃣ **Clarity > Cleverness**  
- Write so that *agencies, clients, junior devs* can all understand.  

2️⃣ **Explain why** when possible  
- Not just "Do X", but "Do X because Y".  

3️⃣ **Favor transparency**  
- DenoGenesis is a counter-force to centralization → document choices openly.  

4️⃣ **Use consistent tone**  
- Professional, friendly, empowering.  
- Avoid arrogance, avoid over-hyping → let the architecture speak for itself.  

---

## 🔗 Cross-linking

✅ When referring to APIs, routes, components → link to relevant files when possible:

Example:

- See [`/routes/notificationsRoutes.ts`](../routes/notificationsRoutes.ts) for WS broadcast API.

✅ When referring to project philosophy → link to `/docs/rethinkx.md`.

---

## 🧠 Living Document

This `Documentation-Standards.md` is a **living document** — update it as DenoGenesis evolves.

Every major contributor should review this once before contributing.
