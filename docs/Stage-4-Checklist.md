# 🚀 DenoGenesis — Stage 4 Master Checklist
_Accelerate architecture maturity → World-class sovereign-first framework_

---

## 🎯 Goal of Stage 4

✅ Transition from **scaling architecture** → to **scalable framework with clear standards**  
✅ Harden core → REST + WebSocket Hybrid → reliable + extensible  
✅ Build Transparency-first UX → System Info → Logs → Notifications  
✅ Enable agencies to start customizing + extending safely  
✅ Prepare for Plugin layer → future extensibility

---

## 🗂️ Architecture Hardening

- [ ] Harden WebSocket Layer:
    - [ ] Implement "Rooms" → WS groups (Home, Dashboard, Agencies)
    - [ ] Implement `/api/ws/connected-count` → live connected clients
    - [ ] Implement reconnection-safe WebSocket Client logic (auto-reconnect)
    - [ ] Implement WS middleware → Auth-protected rooms / messages
    - [ ] Document WebSocket API → `docs/ws-api.md`

- [ ] Refactor Router layer:
    - [ ] Ensure all routers are thin → `.get() .post() .put() .delete()`
    - [ ] Consistent ordering:
        - Middleware first
        - Controllers second
    - [ ] Remove redundant Context passing where not needed
    - [ ] Document Router Standards → `docs/router-standards.md`

---

## 🖥️ Admin Dashboard UX Expansion

- [ ] Implement System Info API → `/api/system/info`
    - Return version, uptime, WS connected clients, memory usage
    - Add System Info Panel in Admin Dashboard

- [ ] Implement NotificationsController → `/api/notifications`:
    - Broadcast endpoint → Admins can send messages → live WS broadcast
    - History endpoint → Store notifications → display in Admin Dashboard → audit trail

- [ ] Implement Live Connected Users Panel:
    - Display live WS connected count in Admin Dashboard
    - Auto-update via WS or polling hybrid

- [ ] Implement Access Logs Viewer:
    - View latest login + action logs
    - Implement `/logs/access.log` rotation logic

- [ ] Implement Data Export UI:
    - Add Export Appointments button → download CSV / JSON
    - Add Export User Messages button → download CSV / JSON

---

## ⚙️ Services Layer Maturity

- [ ] Harden Services layer:
    - Move all DB logic to `/models`
    - Ensure Services expose clean, reusable functions:
        - NotificationsService
        - SystemService
        - WSService
        - ExportService (CSV / JSON)
    - Document Services architecture → `docs/services-architecture.md`

---

## 🎨 UX / Design Maturity

- [ ] Harden Theming Architecture:
    - Ensure all CSS uses `main.css` variables
    - Implement Theme Presets → easy switching → Admin Dashboard
    - Add Visual Theme Preview in Settings

- [ ] Implement Agency Branding Pattern:
    - Ensure all theming respects `site_key`
    - Allow different brands / colors / footers per agency
    - Prepare for Agency Plugin API (future Stage 5)

---

## 📜 Process Maturity

- [ ] Automate Version loading:
    - Implement `VERSION` file → auto-load into `/api/system/info`

- [ ] Harden CHANGELOG discipline:
    - Document every release → even small PATCH bumps → habit

- [ ] Harden TODO discipline:
    - Keep `/TODO.md` in version control → update each PR / push

- [ ] Implement System Updates page:
    - `/system-updates.html` → Display CHANGELOG visually → transparency-first UX

---

## 🧠 Stage 4 Mastery Definition

✅ REST + WebSocket Hybrid is clean + reliable  
✅ System Info is exposed → transparency-first UX  
✅ Notifications are WS-driven → UX-first → Logs available  
✅ Routers → Services → Models → clean separation  
✅ Theming is mature → agency branding supported  
✅ Data Export APIs → ownership-first principle fully respected  
✅ Admin Dashboard → professional UX → production-ready  
✅ CHANGELOG discipline + VERSION discipline → in place  
✅ Framework is ready to attract Agencies + Early Adopters

---
