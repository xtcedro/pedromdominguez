    <h2 class="scroll-trigger">🌵 My Story</h2>
    <p class="scroll-trigger">
      I was born in <strong>Ciudad Juárez, México</strong> 🇲🇽 and grew up in <strong>Praxedis G. Guerrero</strong> before my family brought me to <strong>Oklahoma City</strong>. Ever since, I’ve been driven by a single goal: to give my community and local businesses the power to own their digital real estate — from database to domain.
    </p>

    <h2 class="scroll-trigger">🧩 Why I Built DenoGenesis</h2>
    <p class="scroll-trigger">
      Big Tech has turned the web into a maze of black-box systems, hidden costs, and vendor lock-ins. I see that as modern techno-feudalism — and I’m not here for it. I built <strong>DenoGenesis</strong> to flip that script. It’s a sovereign-first meta framework that makes local-first, audit-friendly development possible for anyone — whether you’re an entrepreneur, a small business owner, or a community org.
    </p>

    <h2 class="scroll-trigger">🚀 How I Work</h2>
    <p class="scroll-trigger">
      I blend my corridos roots, my love for Linux, and my cinematic design sense into every project. From custom boot sequences to scroll-triggered effects, every site I build is transparent, human, and yours to own — forever. No black-box AI. No hidden middlemen. Just open, sovereign code.
    </p>

    <h2 class="scroll-trigger">🌍 Oklahoma City Is My Home</h2>
    <p class="scroll-trigger">
      I care deeply about my community. I believe the people of Oklahoma City — and everyday folks everywhere — deserve real control over their digital future. When you work with me, you’re not just buying a website. You’re claiming your digital independence — one line of code at a time.
