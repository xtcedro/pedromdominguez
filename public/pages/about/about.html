    <h2 class="scroll-trigger">🌟 My Journey</h2>
    <p class="scroll-trigger">
      Born in <strong>Ciudad Juárez, México</strong> 🇲🇽 and raised in <strong>Praxedis G. Guerrero</strong>, I found my home and purpose in <strong>Oklahoma City</strong>. I’ve seen firsthand how local businesses struggle to control their tech. My mission is simple: give my community the tools to own their digital future — with zero middlemen.
    </p>

    <h2 class="scroll-trigger">🧩 Building DenoGenesis</h2>
    <p class="scroll-trigger">
      Big Tech profits from lock-ins and black-box code — I call it modern techno-feudalism. <strong>DenoGenesis</strong> is my antidote. It’s a local-first, audit-friendly meta framework that helps entrepreneurs, non-profits, and small businesses build transparent systems they truly own.
    </p>

    <h2 class="scroll-trigger">🎬 How I Craft Digital Experiences</h2>
    <p class="scroll-trigger">
      My work is a fusion of my roots, Linux philosophy, and a love for cinematic design. I build custom boot loaders, scroll animations, and sovereign code bases — all tailored to you. I don’t believe in hidden fees, black-box AI, or shady vendor agreements. With me, what you see is what you own.
    </p>

    <h2 class="scroll-trigger">📍 Grounded in Oklahoma City</h2>
    <p class="scroll-trigger">
      Oklahoma City is more than my base — it’s my community. I want everyday people here to thrive. When you work with me, you get more than a website. You get a resilient, local-first system that protects your data, your business, and your future.
