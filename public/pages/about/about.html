      <p class="hero-subheading" data-typed>
        I’m Pedro — a self-taught systems architect and the founder of <strong>DenoGenesis</strong>,
        based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. I’m about to turn 30, and this is my honest story.

    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>
      I didn’t take the traditional path. I don’t have a degree, credentials, or a shiny corporate resume.
      Instead, I’ve spent the last several years learning by doing — building, experimenting, and yes,
      making plenty of mistakes along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I’m focused on improving the local tech ecosystem here in Oklahoma City — because I believe
      we deserve technology that serves our communities, not just Big Tech profits.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m not perfect. But I’m here — every day — showing up, building, and helping businesses reclaim
      their digital independence.

    <h2>What is DenoGenesis?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>DenoGenesis</strong> is my flagship project — a sovereign-first, local-first web framework
      built with the <strong>Deno runtime</strong>, TypeScript, Oak, MySQL or MongoDB, and modern best practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      With DenoGenesis, any local business or organization can run transparent, auditable systems that they
      own completely — no black-box code, no hidden cloud lock-ins, and no unnecessary middlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s designed to cut development time by up to 80% while keeping everything simple, lightweight,
      and easy to host on small local servers or VPS. It’s my way of democratizing software development,
      one system at a time.

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      I know I have a lot to learn. I know I have more to prove. But I also know I’m not afraid to get
      my hands dirty to build real solutions for real people.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re in Oklahoma City — or anywhere, really — and you believe in local-first, honest,
      sovereign tech — I’d love to connect.
